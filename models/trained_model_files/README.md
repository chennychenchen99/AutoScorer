# Download the Model Files

Go to our project Google Drive folder here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wAfL-15s6qEdVkyqX0Ia-BfGcdVORafb
and drag the model folders from the Drive into this directory.

These are the three model folders:
1) model_bert_small
2) model_bert
3) model_glove

To run the web app, at least model_bert_small must be downloaded into this directory.
